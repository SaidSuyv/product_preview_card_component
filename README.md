## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would totally like to perfect the use of Grid in CSS, it was quite difficult for me to use it and I needed to look for some things. Also maybe trying to improve my CSS skills for a better performance.
